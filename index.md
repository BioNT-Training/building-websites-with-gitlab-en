:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

## Prerequisites

Before following this lesson, learners should ideally be able to:

1. create a project on [GitLab][gitlab] / [EMBL GitLab][embl-gitlab].
2. clone a local copy of a project with Git, add and commit modified files, and push/pull changes between local and remote repositories.
3. execute commands in the shell.

None of the prerequisite above is absolutely necessary to follow the lesson.
They will, however, be necessary to efficiently manage the website development from your
laptop and test how it looks before creating official versions.

If you'd like to learn any of the skills listed above,
the [Software Carpentry][swc] lessons on
[the Shell][swc-shell]
and [Git][swc-git] are a good place to start.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For those already familiar with the ways that Git
and an online platform like GitLab or GitHub
can help them track and compare changes to flat text files
and collaborate with others on projects,
**GitLab** (and GitHub) **Pages** provide a cost-free way to
build and host webpages.
This approach is commonly used to provide documentation
on software projects,
and to create blogs and websites for
individuals and organisations already used to working with
the Git toolset for their other projects.
However, for those taking their first steps towards building sites like this,
the process can be confusing and intimidating.
This tutorial aims to address this,
by

1. providing a step-by-step guide to creating a collection of pages,
2. showing multiple examples of how to structure them into a coherent site,
3. demostrating how to use multiple frameworks for web pages development, from plain *HTML* to *Jekyll* and *Sphinx*.

The difference between GitLab and GitHub pages development will also be briefly discussed.

## Outdated Screenshots

Throughout this lesson we will make use and show content and screenshots from [git.embl.de][embl-gitlab].
As an ever evolving platform, GitLab is always adding new features
and new visual elements to its website.
**Screenshots** in the lesson may then become out-of-sync, refer or show content that no longer exists.

If during the lesson you find **screenshots** that no longer match what you see in your browser,
please [open an issue](https://git.embl.de/grp-bio-it-workshops/building-websites-with-gitlab/-/issues)
describing what you see and how it differs from the lesson content.
Feel free to add as many screenshots as necessary to clarify the discrepancy.
